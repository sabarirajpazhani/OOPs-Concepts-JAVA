## Demo
Explore a [Java Program Demo](Demo.java) that illustrates the key concepts of OOP in Java. This includes how to define classes, create objects, and call methods.

## Methods in Java
A **method** in Java is a block of code that performs a specific task. It can be invoked to execute the code it contains.
 - **Method with Return Type**
      A method that returns a value after execution. The return type is specified before the method name (e.g., `int`, `String`).
      Explore the [Method with Return Type Program](Methods/Methods.java)
 - **Method without Return Type**
   Type: A method that does not return any value. It uses the void keyword.
   Explore the [Method without Return Type Program](Methods/Methods.java)

## Recursion
Recursion in Java is demonstrated through a Factorial Program that computes the factorial of a number using recursive calls. Explore a [Program](Recusion.java)

## Class and Object
Understand the basics of Class and Object in Java, including how to instantiate objects and use their methods and attributes. Explore a [Program](ClassAndObject.java)
#### Syntax for Class Creation
```java
access_modifier class ClassName {
    // Fields (attributes)

    // Constructor

    // Methods
}
```
#### Syntax for Object Creation
```java
ClassName objectName = new ClassName(arguments);
```

## OOPs Pillars
The pillars of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) are foundational concepts that define how to design and structure programs in an object-oriented way:

### 1. **Inheritance**
Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class, promoting code reuse and hierarchical classification.

- **Single Inheritance:**  
  A class inherits from one single superclass. This is the simplest form of inheritance.  
  [See the Program](OOPsPillers/Inheritance/SingleInheritance.java)

- **Multiple Inheritance:**  
  A class inherits from more than one superclass. Java does not support multiple inheritance directly to avoid the "diamond problem," but similar behavior can be achieved using interfaces.  
  [See the Program](OOPsPillers/Inheritance/MultipleInheritanceUsingInterface.java)

- **Multilevel Inheritance:**  
  A class is derived from another class, which in turn is derived from another class, forming a chain of inheritance.  
  [See the Program](OOPsPillers/Inheritance/MultilevelInheritance.java)

- **Hybrid Inheritance:**  
  A combination of two or more types of inheritance. Java supports hybrid inheritance using interfaces since multiple inheritance is not allowed directly.  
  [See the Program](OOPsPillers/Inheritance/HybridInheritance.java)

- **Hierarchical Inheritance:**  
  Multiple classes inherit from a single superclass, creating a tree-like structure with one parent and multiple child classes.  
  [See the Program](OOPsPillers/Inheritance/HierarchicalInheritance.java)

### 2. **Polymorphism**
Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling one action to be performed in different ways. In Java, it can be achieved through:

- **Method Overloading:**  
  Multiple methods have the same name but different parameters within the same class.
  [See the Program](OOPsPillers/Polymorphism/MethodOverLoading.java)

- **Method Overriding:**  
  A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
  [See the Program](OOPsPillers/Polymorphism/MethodOverRidding.java)

### 3. **Encapsulation**
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, typically using private fields and public getter and setter methods to control access.

- **Encapsulation Example:**  
  Learn how encapsulation is achieved in Java through getter and setter methods.  
  [See the Program](OOPsPillers/Encapsulation/EncapsulationExample.java)

### 4. **Abstraction**
Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

- **Abstraction Example:**  
  Explore abstraction in Java through abstract classes and methods.

## Exception Handling
Exception handling in Java is a powerful mechanism that handles runtime errors, ensuring the normal flow of the application is maintained. Java provides several keywords to handle exceptions such as `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `throws`, and `finally`.

### 1. **ArithmeticException**
This exception occurs when an arithmetic operation, such as division by zero, is attempted. Java automatically handles such exceptions, but you can also catch and handle them manually.

- **ArithmeticException Example:**  
  [See the Program](ExceptionalHandling/ArithmaticException.java)

### 2. **Finally**
The `finally` block is used to execute important code such as closing resources, regardless of whether an exception is handled or not. It is executed after the `try` and `catch` blocks.

- **Finally Example:**  
  [See the Program](ExceptionalHandling/Finally.java)

### 3. **Throw**
The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception, either a predefined exception or a custom exception. It is used within a method or a block of code.

- **Throw Example:**  
  [See the Program](ExceptionalHandling/Throw.java)

### 4. **User-Defined Exception**
Java allows you to create your own exception classes. These user-defined exceptions can be thrown and caught like built-in exceptions.

- **User-Defined Exception Example:**  
  [See the Program](ExceptionalHandling/UserDefinedException.java)

## Constructor
A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize objects. It is called when an object of a class is created. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type. There are two types of constructors in Java: default constructors and parameterized constructors.

### 1. **Default Constructor**
A default constructor is a constructor that takes no arguments. If no constructor is explicitly defined in a class, Java provides a default constructor automatically.

- **Default Constructor Example:**  
  [See the Program](Constructor/DefaultConstructor.java)

### 2. **Parameterized Constructor**
A parameterized constructor is a constructor that takes arguments to initialize an object with specific values.

- **Parameterized Constructor Example:**  
  [See the Program](Constructor/ParameterConstructor.java)

## Abstract Class and Abstract Method
Abstraction is one of the fundamental concepts of OOP that focuses on hiding the implementation details from the user and showing only the essential features of the object. In Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and abstract methods.

### 1. **Abstract Class**
An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It may contain abstract methods (methods without a body) as well as concrete methods (methods with a body).

### 2. **Abstract Method**
An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation (no body). It must be overridden by subclasses that inherit the abstract class.


## Special Keys
Java provides several special keywords that have specific purposes and play an important role in the language's functionality. Hereâ€™s an overview of the special keywords `final`, `static`, `super`, and `this`.

### 1. **`final` Keyword**
The `final` keyword in Java is used to define constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance of classes. It can be applied to variables, methods, and classes.

- **Final Keyword Example:**  
  [See the Program](SpecialKeyWords/FinalKey.java)

### 2. **`static` Keyword**
The `static` keyword is used to define class-level methods and variables that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. It is also used for memory management.

- **Static Keyword Example:**  
  [See the Program](SpecialKeyWords/StaticKeyWord.java)

### 3. **`super` Keyword**
The `super` keyword is used to refer to the immediate parent class of the current object. It is used to access parent class methods and constructors that are hidden by the child class.

- **Super Keyword Example:**  
  [See the Program](SpecialKeyWords/SuperKey.java)

### 4. **`this` Keyword**
The `this` keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the class. It can be used to distinguish instance variables from local variables, call other constructors, and pass the current object as a parameter.

- **This Keyword Example:**  
  [See the Program](SpecialKeyWords/thisKey.java)
